        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-grey-40 u-text-2"> Business Process Management (BPM) is the research field that investigates methods and techniques for describing, managing and improving the organization, control and interplay of activities, data and resources employed by companies and organizations to cooperatively achieve the desired outcome.&nbsp;​Processes thus take into account not only the complex operational structure of the organization but also consider actors and possible objects and artifacts that these actors deal with during their work. Therefore, it becomes crucial that processes are correctly specified (preferably using a language with a mathematically defined meaning) and that their outcomes fulfill the intended requirements of the process and reach the planned goals. Due to design mistakes, process executions may result in unwanted behaviors that violate (some of) the predetermined objectives.&nbsp;<br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-grey-40 u-text-3"> Formal methods are a set of techniques, methods and tools that exploit rigorous mathematical notions for the specification, development, and analysis of complex systems. The main idea behind the use of formal methods is motivated by the expectation that performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability, trustworthiness and robustness of the design of a system. Formal methods techniques are based on mathematics, formal logic, and, in general, on various instruments supplied by theoretical computer science and its foundations. These techniques are usually employed to formally verify hardware or software systems against some property of interest, to assess whether these systems satisfy it or not. In the field of BPM, formal methods can provide a repertoire consisting of both theoretical and practical toolkits to guarantee the correctness of processes and assess their capability to reach predetermined Key Performance Indicators.</p>

        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2"> Providing rigorous specification and analytic techniques for process-aware information systems is one of the main tasks to address in Business Process Management. For this purpose, in the last two decades well-established approaches from Formal Methods have been successfully developed and adopted so as to provide solid foundations and concrete tools for the automated analysis and testing of complex processes.&nbsp;<br>FM-BPM welcomes submissions of abstracts that use Formal Methods to specify, model and analyze  business processes and process-aware information systems.  The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in the application of formal methods to improve the quality of information systems, and specifically those that rely on BPM concepts and technologies. FMBPM strives at promoting research and development of formal methods and tools in all areas related to BPM: industrial applications, theoretical frameworks, formal modeling, algorithms and methodologies, tooling, experience reports including teaching and industrial cases.&nbsp;<br>In addition, the workshop will provide a platform for discussions and the exchange of innovative ideas, thus we also highly encourage submissions on work in progress.
        </p>
        <h3 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-3">Submission Details</h3>
         <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4"> All abstract should be in English and describe original work that has not been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee. Only abstracts in English will be considered.

The title page must contain a short abstract and a list of keywords, preferably using the list of topics given above. Papers must be submitted electronically via EasyChair: enter the main conference installation (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025</a>) and select “Workshop on Formal Methods for BPM” as the submission track.<br>

          <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4"> 
          We are interested in abstracts focusing on the following topics: (1) the current position of Formal Methods in the BPM community and the adoption challenges, (2) applications of formal methods techniques to business processes and interesting cross-disciplinary  technical challenges.
          </p>

           <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4"> 
          Abstracts should contain at least 500 characters and should not exceed 1250 characters. These submissions will pose the basis for the discussion during the workshop in two corresponding sessions. 
          </p>

           <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4"> 
          The intended outcome of the workshop will be to produce a joint paper through a collaborative writing session, building on discussions and insights from FM-BPM 2024 and expanding on the submitted topics. All contributors from both editions will be included as co-authors.
          At least an author per each accepted abstract is expected to be at the workshop in person to present their idea and actively contribute to the cooperative efforts in sight on the day of the event.

       <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-13"> The workshop will be a fully interactive event, providing a unique opportunity for active participation and discussion among enthusiasts from the BPM community in the use of formal methods for business process modeling and analysis.</p>

        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-13">
          We propose the FM-BPM’2025 attendees to reflect on the following topics:
          </p>

<ul class="u-align-left u-text u-text-14">
          <li>
Topic #1: What from the domain of Formal Methods is currently needed in the Process Science community? </li>

<li>Topic #2: What are the actual use cases in BPM/PM/… where FM are actually needed?</li>

<li>Topic #3: Formal Methods in the Process Science courses: need, topics & challenges. What are the expected outcomes of such courses?</li>
</ul>

<p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-13">
The ultimate goal of these discussion rounds is to understand why, where and how formal methods can support process science </p>
